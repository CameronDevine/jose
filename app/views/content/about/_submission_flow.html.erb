<p class="lead">
  Preparing your JOSE submission should be a simple task, once you have a complete
  software or learning module you wish to publish.
</p>

<h2>The two submission types</h2>

<p>
  JOSE accepts two types of submissions: (1) computational learning modules, created
  as open educational resources (OER), and (2) open-source software, created as
  educational technology or infrastructure.
</p>

<h3>Submission requirements</h3>

<p>
  JOSE submissions must be fully open, under the <a href="http://opendefinition.org">Open Definition</a>. 
  This means that any text content or graphical objects should be under a Creative
  Commons license (ideally CC-BY) and code components should be under an 
  <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses">OSI-approved license</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Computational learning modules should be complete and immediately usable for
  self-learning or adoption by other instructors. They should make a clear contribution
  to teaching and learning of any subject, supported by computing. JOSE is not focused
  in OER for "learning to code" as much as "coding to learn."
</p>

<p>
  Software submissions should make a clear contribution to the available open-source software
  that supports teaching and learning, or makes an educational process better (e.g., faster,
  easier, simpler). Examples include software to auto-grade student work, learning management
  systems, and student collaboration frameworks. Software should be feature-complete
  (no half-baked solutions).
</p>

<h3>What about novelty?</h3>

<p>
  Authors make the case for their submission's contribution in the paper, under the heading
  "Statement of Need." The criterion is less one of novelty, than <em>need</em>: submissions
  targeting subjects or applications already addressed by other resources <em>are eligible</em>,
  if the authors make a case for why they might be adopted by learners or other instructors.
