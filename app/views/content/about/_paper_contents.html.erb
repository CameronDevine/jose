<p>
  JOSE papers should:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>List all authors and affiliations.</li>
  <li>For software submissions, describe the functionality of the software, usage and 
    recent experience of use in teaching and learning situations. For learning modules, 
    describe the learning objectives, content, instructional design, and experience of use in 
    teaching and learning situations.</li>
  <li>Include a statement of need, explaining the contribution made by the submitted 
    artifacts to computationally enabled teaching and learning, and describing how they 
    might be adopted by others.</li>
  <li>List key references including a link to the open archive of the sofware or the 
    learning module.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  JOSE welcomes submissions with diverse educational contexts. You should write your paper
  for a non-specialist reader. Your submission should probably be somewhere between
  250-1000 words.
</p>

<p>
JOSE papers contain a limited set of metadata, plus Summary & Reference sections. We explicitly
  do not publish long-form articles, because the scholarship represented by a JOSE article is
  contained in the software or learning modules themselves. Expected length less than 1000 words.
